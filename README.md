# Weather Application built with PyOWM

This program is probably one of the easiest things to make, as it is simple and everything you need is handed straight to you
but I decided to make it EVEN more simple so you just have to add your OWM Weather token and you're done. Feel free to make a
much better version, if I see it, I will probably delete this repo.
